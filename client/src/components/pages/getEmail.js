            <br/>
                My name is Chloe and I am a resident of New York.
            <br/>
                I am writing to you today on behalf of the planet, as I am greatly concerned that not enough action is being taken to combat the current climate crisis. I use the word crisis because that is what we are facing.
            <br/>
                Carbon emissions are rising and the 100 companies are responsible for 71% of these emissions are not being held responsible.
            <br/>
                The 2021 IPCC report on climate change states that we are in a code red for humanity. By 2040 we will reach 1.5 degrees of warming and we will need to cut emissions in HALF by 2030 and reach net zero to avoid a complete climate catastrophe.
            <br/>
                We are not equipped to handle a climate catastrophe. It will leave us vulnerable, exposed and with a global food supply shortage.
            <br/>
                We have yet to see our representatives take drastic enough action (if any) to help prevent this. Instead, we expand pipelines putting money into the governmentâ€™s pocket and subsidize oil and gas companies.
            <br/>
                We are creating a mess for the youth that cannot yet vote but will surely be left in the devastating aftermath of our choices today.
            <br/>
                It is way past time to act. I am reaching out on not only her behalf but on behalf of the youth, marginalized people groups and our country as a whole. Renewable energy is more affordable than ever, and supporting a green economy not only saves our future but ensures jobs and security while we do so.
                I am calling on you to act.
            <br/>
            <br/>
                Hoping for a future,
            <br/>
                Chloe
